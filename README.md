# ‚è≥ Chronos Atlas: The Historical Timeline Project

**A modern, data-driven visualization of history powered by Python, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL.**

This project aims to transform the consumption of biographical and historical data into an interactive, visual experience. By linking figures, works, and influences across time, Chronos Atlas provides unprecedented chronological context to history.

---

## üéØ Core Value Proposition

The primary goal is to launch a scalable web application featuring a stunning **Master Timeline View**. Users can explore the overlapping lives and events of historical figures, filtering by field, occupation, and influence.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Interactive Timeline** | Visually displays the lifespan of historical figures on a scrollable, zoomable axis. |
| **Relational Data** | Utilizes a graph-like model to clearly show **who influenced whom** and their contemporaries. |
| **Optimized Speed** | Built on a high-performance backend stack designed to handle complex chronological queries at scale. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

Chronos Atlas is built on a **Python/PostgreSQL/GraphQL** foundation, chosen specifically for its power in handling complex relational and time-series data.

| Layer | Primary Technology | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend/API** | **Python (Django)** + **GraphQL (Graphene)** | Fast development, structured framework, and efficient data transfer. |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL** üêò | **Core performance engine.** Superior indexing for time-series and relational integrity. |
| **Performance** | **Redis** + **Celery** | Caching API responses and handling heavy, background data ingestion (ETL). |
| **Data Source** | **Wikidata (SPARQL)** | Structured, open source for reliable historical data. |
